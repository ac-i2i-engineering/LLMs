# LangChain
LangChain is a framework developed to facilitate the construction and deployment of applications that use language models like GPT (from OpenAI) and other AI technologies. It provides a set of tools and libraries that help developers handle common tasks such as chaining together multiple language model calls, integrating external knowledge sources, and managing dialog states. This framework aims to simplify the complexities involved in building language-based AI applications, ensuring that developers can focus more on creating unique functionalities rather than dealing with the intricacies of underlying model operations.

# LangGraph
LangGraph, on the other hand, is less well-known and may refer to different projects or tools depending on the context. Generally, it could be a tool or library that focuses on analyzing and visualizing relationships and data through graph-based structures, possibly integrating with language processing to enhance data interpretation or query handling. It can provide valuable insights by connecting disparate pieces of information in a network, enhancing understanding and interaction with language data.
